ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system developed using Python. 
This system uses the TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors and applies cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between movies. 
It then recommends similar movies based on a selected movie.

Features:

Content-based recommendation: Recommends movies based on movie descriptions and metadata.
TF-IDF Vectorizer: Transforms movie data into numerical vectors.
Cosine Similarity: Calculates the similarity between movies.
Flask Integration: The system is hosted as a web application using Flask.
